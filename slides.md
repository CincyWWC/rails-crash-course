# Introduction to Ruby

# History of Ruby

* Created by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in 1995 in Japan
* First English-language book was published in 2000
* Around 2005, DHH (David Heinemeier Hansson) was hired by 37Signals to create Basecamp
* Once Basecamp was built, DHH extracted the web framework used from it, creating **Rails**
* Rails has powered the popularity of Ruby ever since

# Running Ruby

* Ruby is an interpreted language, runs on a virtual machine (VM)
* There are multiple versions of the Ruby virtual machine, one of the most common being MRI (Matz's Ruby Interpreter)
* Other examples of interpreted languages are
  * Javascript
  * Python
  * Perl
* You can run Ruby files on the command line using `ruby filename.rb`

---

# Interactive Ruby

* You can run Ruby commands interactively using the REPL
  * **R** - Reads in the command, parses it into memory
  * **E** - Evaluate the command
  * **P** - Print the result
  * **L** - Loop to start the process all over again
* `irb` is the command that starts the REPL for Ruby
